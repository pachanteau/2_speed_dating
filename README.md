# Speed Dating

## Challenge description
We will start a new data visualization and exploration project. Your goal will be to try to understand love! It's a very complicated subject so we've simplified it. Your goal is going to be to understand what happens during a speed dating and especially to understand what will influence the obtaining of a second date.

This is a Kaggle competition on which you can find more details here :

[Speed Dating Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/annavictoria/speed-dating-experiment#Speed%20Dating%20Data%20Key.doc)

Take some time to read the description of the challenge and try to understand each of the variables in the dataset. Help yourself with this from the document : Speed Dating - Variable Description.md

## Rendering
To be successful in this project, you will need to do a descriptive analysis of the main factors that influence getting a second appointment.

Over the next few days, you'll learn how to use python libraries like seaborn, plotly and bokeh to produce data visualizations that highlight relevant facts about the dataset.

For today, you can start exploring the dataset with pandas to extract some statistics.
